Life simulation based on simplified chemistry


Chemistry
=========

* Each substance has a 'spread' ratio and takes part into one or more reaction.

* Reaction
    input subtsances
    output substances
    probability / reaction speed?

* Each substance must be appear at least in one reaction as input and at least in a reaction as output


Biochemistry
============

* Each substance is named after the RNA sequence it activates

* Genetic code executes from that sequence onward

* RNA expression: increase or decrease probability of a reaction

* Space is divided in square tiles
* Each tile contains different substances in different quantities
* Each tile can contain a cell, defined by its dna code

??? death (too many reactions?)
??? reproduction (too many specific substances?)


Iteration
=========
  - substances activate RNA
  - rna tilts local chemistry by changin reaction speeds (additive?)
  - reactions ensue
  - new substances spread
